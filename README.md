# Accomodation-Project
At firt I extracted a specified column to work then I started with the preprocessing part: cleaning data, tokenization, deleting stop words and appliying TF-IDF. 
Then moving to the processing part, I tried k-means clustering but it wasn't efficient since I have to identify the number of clusters at first, So Agglomerative Clustering was a better solution.
At the end, as a way of evaluating the results, I made two CSV files: one containing only the unique names of each hotel and the other one containing the name of the hotels and all its duplicates.
